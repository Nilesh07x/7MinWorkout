The 7 Minute Workout App is a simple, effective, and beginner-friendly Android fitness application designed to guide users through a scientifically proven 7-minute workout routine. The app includes 12 exercises, each lasting 30 seconds with a 10-second rest period in between. It features a clean and modern user interface, clear exercise visuals, circular progress indicators, and text-to-speech support that announces exercise names so users can follow along hands-free. During rest time, the app displays the upcoming exercise, and automatic transitions make the workout flow smoothly without requiring user input. A skip button can also be added to allow users to skip any exercise they want.

The application offers a built-in BMI Calculator that supports both Metric units (kg/cm) and US units (lbs/feet/inches). It calculates BMI, identifies the user’s BMI category, and provides a short health message. The design uses Material Components, TextInputLayouts, and clear form validation for a premium user experience. Completed workouts are automatically saved in a Workout History stored locally using SQLite, allowing users to track their progress over time. The app also includes a custom toolbar, a personalized footer (“Design by Nilesh”), and a custom launcher icon.

From a technical standpoint, the app is built in Kotlin using Android View Binding, RecyclerView, CountDownTimer, TextToSpeech, MediaPlayer, and Intents for navigation. The UI is composed with ConstraintLayout and Material Design, while all exercise data is stored in a Kotlin object class for easy management. A horizontal status tracker visually shows which exercises are pending, currently active, and completed. The project structure is clean and follows recommended Android architecture practices, making the app easy to maintain and extend.

The 7 Minute Workout App is lightweight, works offline, supports most Android versions, and provides a smooth fitness experience. It can be further improved with features like custom workout creation, reminders, progress analytics, or dark mode. Overall, it is a complete, practical, and user-friendly fitness solution built with modern Android development tools and best practices.
